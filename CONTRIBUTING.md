# Contributing to How to Program

## Getting started

For now we're not using the Github (GH) issues board, since there is not a lot of complexity in the project. Instead we're just ussing this [TODO file](TODO.md) to track what is being done.

Feel free to open a PR setting your name under some of those tasks to avoid another person start working on the same and when you're ready open a PR with the changes and removing the task from the TODO file.

If you have some doubts how to contribute, [these steps](https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312) will help you
